**Live Website https://elena-pakhmurskaia.github.io/Milestone_1/index.html**

## **UX**
This project was designed to promote language learning services. The goal of the project is to attract new clients. 
A potential client is a person who is looking for private/skype/group lessons to learn Russian. 
The visitor of the page should be able to sign up for a trial lesson. Therefore, the trial lessons button appears on every page of the website. 
The aim is not to overload visitors with too much information but rather make it easier to start up a conversation by arranging a free trial lesson. 
High-level information about provided services, course prices/details, teacher profile, and reasons to learn Russian is provided on different pages to break down the information.
Potential user profile: wants to learn Russian but not looking for a language school or teacher matching websites; potential users want to connect with the prospective teacher directly. 
A trial lesson button is placed on every page, the button sends the user to the contact form where he/she is encouraged to contact the teacher.

### **Acknowledgements**
The idea for this project came as way to attract new students for my lessons. Most of the students found me through the teacher-student matching websites where students have to pay a fee to contact me. I wanted to eliminate third party from the conversation between students and me.
